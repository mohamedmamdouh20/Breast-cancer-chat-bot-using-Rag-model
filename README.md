# Breast Cancer Chatbot Using RAG Model

This project was developed as part of my graduation project at DEPI. The main goal of this project was to create an intelligent chatbot capable of assisting users with information related to breast cancer.

## Project Overview
The chatbot utilizes a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model**, which combines the power of retrieval-based methods with generative AI models. This hybrid approach allows the chatbot to provide accurate, context-aware, and natural language responses to user queries.

## Key Features
- **Arabic Language Support**: The chatbot is capable of understanding and responding in Arabic, making it more accessible to Arabic-speaking users.
- **Information Retrieval**: The system can search a database of relevant documents to provide factual, evidence-based responses.
- **Contextual Responses**: The RAG model generates human-like, contextually aware responses to user questions.

## Technologies Used
- **RAG Model**: Combines the power of retrieval and generative AI models.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For language understanding and response generation.
- **Machine Learning**: To train the model for better contextual understanding.

## Purpose
This project aims to offer a helpful and accessible way for users to obtain information related to breast cancer. It demonstrates how AI and machine learning can be applied to the healthcare field, enhancing user experience and access to vital knowledge.
